			<h2>Future work</h2>
			<p>
				This page contains a list of features that are part of the future work
				related with Amstel.
			</p>
				
				
			<div class="section-title">
				Distributed filesystem dedicated for graph storage 
			</div>
			<div class="section-content">I/O is the biggest bottleneck that the
framework currently has. Running algorithms for huge graphs means also
reading efficiently this huge information. In the current version the
input phase takes even more than the entire algorithm computation. Also
due to limited I/O capabilities (text files for now) we cannot implement
Writers because we cannot handle and coordinate efficiently such a huge
amount of information.
			</div>
			<div class="section-title">
			Multithreaded workers			
			</div>
			<div class="section-content">Currently only the main thread computes
the vertices, but having multiple threads doing this will make use of
the multi-core CPUs from DAS3. This means that the master node has to
distribute multiple graph partitions to the same worker node, and thatâ€™s
also benefic for load balancing.
			</div>
			
			<div class="section-title">
			Topology mutations
			</div>
			<div class="section-content">Doing the topology mutation operations
like adding or removing edges should be straightforward since the vertex
state is entirely in memory. The main problem is that if we do topology
mutations, we would eventually want to write the new graph in a
persistent storage, and we reach the Writers problem mentioned before.</div>
